# LAVA - Legal Analysis Video Assistant

LAVA (Legal Analysis Video Assistant) is an advanced AI-powered tool designed to analyze video and audio content for legal purposes. It transcribes audio, processes video frames, and evaluates them against legal standards (e.g., U.S. federal laws, California state laws) to provide insights for both prosecution and defense. The tool leverages NLP, sentiment analysis, and AI models to simulate human-like legal reasoning.

## Features
- **Transcription**: Converts speech to text using `SpeechRecognition`.
- **Video Processing**: Analyzes video frames for relevant legal issues using `opencv-python`.
- **Legal Analysis**: Uses NLP and AI models from `transformers` and `torch` to analyze text data and identify potential legal violations.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Provides spoken feedback using `pyttsx3`.
- **Human-like Reasoning**: Mimics a judge, lawyer, and defense attorney using advanced AI models.
  
## System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows 11
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code (VSC)
- **Shells**: Bash, Windows PowerShell 7

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.8+**: You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **pip**: Python's package installer, usually included with Python.
- **Virtual Environment**: (Recommended) Set up a virtual environment for isolated package management.
  
### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Puhfee/LAVA.git
   cd LAVA
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/Scripts/activate  # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install all required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   You will need an `.env` file for storing your API keys and other configurations. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with the following structure:

   ```plaintext
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries, which are listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

- **nltk==3.9.1**: For natural language processing tasks.
- **opencv-python==4.10.0.84**: For video processing.
- **numpy==1.26.4**: For numerical operations.
- **SpeechRecognition==3.10.4**: For transcribing speech to text.
- **pyttsx3==2.97**: For text-to-speech functionality.
- **transformers==4.44.2**: For loading AI models.
- **torch==2.4.1**: PyTorch for model inference.
- **tqdm==4.66.5**: For progress monitoring.
- **beautifulsoup4==4.12.3**: For HTML parsing.
- **click==8.1.7**: For building command-line interfaces.
- **colorama==0.4.6**: For colored terminal output.

## Usage

After setting up the environment, run the main script to start the LAVA assistant:

```bash
python main.py
```

LAVA will begin listening for commands and analyzing video and audio input based on your legal data.
