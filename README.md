### **LAVA - Legal Action Video Analyzer**

**LAVA (Legal Action Video Analyzer)** is an advanced AI tool designed to analyze legal scenarios from video content. It combines cutting-edge **NLP**, **video analysis**, and **machine learning** models to assist with legal case simulations, strategy generation, and in-depth action recognition.

#### **Key Features:**
- **Video Analysis:** Extracts video frames and transcribes audio content to identify key moments.
- **Legal Reasoning:** Simulates courtroom strategies from both the prosecution and defense perspectives.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Understands legal texts and identifies potential violations.
- **Action Recognition:** Detects specific behaviors in videos (e.g., use of force, aggressive actions).
- **Human-Like AI:** Mimics legal experts' reasoning to offer insights into legal conflicts.

#### **Getting Started:**

To get started, clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/LAVA.git
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the main program:
```bash
python main.py
```

#### **Technologies Used:**
- **Python**
- **OpenAI GPT-4**
- **Clarifai API**
- **Speech Recognition**
- **PyQt GUI**

#### **How It Works:**
LAVA listens for wake words, processes video content, transcribes speech, and then analyzes the content using **NLP** and **video action detection** to identify legal issues. It then provides insights from both the prosecution and defense perspectives, simulating courtroom strategies.
